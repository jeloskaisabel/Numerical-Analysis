# Numerical Analysis

## Description
This repository contains various exercises and examples related to numerical analysis. The project includes implementations of different numerical methods used to solve mathematical and scientific problems. The examples are designed to be educational and illustrative, providing insights into the application of numerical techniques.

## Examples Included

### Parachutist Example
- **File**: [Ejemplo del paracaidista.py](https://github.com/jeloskaisabel/Numerical-Analysis/blob/main/Ejemplo%20del%20paracaidista.py)
- **Description**: This script demonstrates the use of numerical methods to analyze the dynamics of a parachutist. It includes the simulation of the parachutist's behavior under various conditions using differential equations.

## Tools and Libraries

### Manim
- **Description**: Manim is an animation engine for explanatory math videos. It is used in this project to create visualizations and animations that help explain complex mathematical concepts in a more understandable way.
- **Installation**:
  ```sh
  pip install manim
  ```
- **Usage**:
  ```sh
  manim -pql your_script.py
  ```
